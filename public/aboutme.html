        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love cats, tacos, and Jeremy Renner. <br/>
            I am from Chicago, IL and grew up in the country. A small town called Spring Valley.<br/>
            For the past 24 years I have lived in Texas. I currently live in the town of Mission.<br/>
            I went to Junior College to be a chef but ended up very ill and unable to finish schooling.<br/>
            However, I worked as a chef at a hotel before I moved into retail.<br/>
            I have also worked at an Eco-dry cleaner as an asst general manager for a few years.<br/> 
            Currently I am a secretary for a local church.<br/>

            I suffer from depression, anxiety and bipolar. I have been this way most of my life. <br/>
            When I was a child, my father beat my mother, and it left a terrible scar on my life. <br/>
            I do not have actual memories of it, but I think it caused some PTSD. My mom left him when <br/>
            I was two, and I never had a good relationship with him.<br/> 
            When I was younger, I suffered from low self-esteem. I was bullied about my weight, and about <br/>
            my clothes which my mom made most of. At that time there were no plus-sized clothing for people. <br/>
            Though I did have friends, I did not have a lot of them. Most of the time I felt like I stood out, <br/>
            and not in a good way.<br/>
            I do have some good memories from childhood, but I was fearful, worried and sad, and overate my worries, <br/>
            fear and sadness. When I was 18 years old, I tried to kill myself. I took over 500 Advil and ended <br/>
            up in ICU getting my stomach pumped. The psychiatrist saw me but said there was nothing wrong with me! <br/>
            He sent me home without any kind of treatment. My depression really took off after that.<br/>
            I also suffered from female problems that left me with heavy, long lasting, and painful periods. <br/>
            I had countless cysts that ruptured, and it was terrible. The hormonal imbalance added to my depression.<br/> 
            I was unable to hold down a job or finish Culinary School. I kept missing days due to my conditions, <br/>
            and it left me feeling worthless. In May of 2012 I felt extremely suicidal again. By this time, I was on <br/>
            and off depression medication, and I needed help. I called the Suicide Hotline, and the police came to <br/>
            my apartment. I was able to get some help after that.<br/>
            I had terrible swings of emotions, and found myself with depression mostly, but sometimes I would be so <br/>
            happy I would be making bad decisions. Decisions like spending too much money and drinking too much. <br/>
            I would feel out of control during those happy times. <br/>
            I decided to give up my apartment and move in with my mom. I was unable to care for myself and I could <br/>
            barely care for my cats. I hired a lawyer and got on disability. I was able to see psychiatrists and <br/>
            get the help I truly needed. That was when I was diagnosed with bipolar. <br/> 
            Even after treatment, I did still feel suicidal. I entered a mental health unit and stayed for two weeks.<br/>
            This is when my migraines went out of control. I was having migraines that lasted for weeks at a time. <br/>
            I could not function. The migraines did not get better, and I ended up not being able to work for 12 years.<br/>
            I did pay my mom some of my disability money for “rent” and it made me feel like I was contributing. <br/>
            The migraines became so bad that they were lasting for months. No kind of treatment helped them. Some <br/>
            of the most common migraine medicines I could not take, and the others simply did not work. I tried Botox, <br/>
            acupuncture, cold packs, medication, and I was in the hospital constantly.<br/> 
            This all made my depression, anxiety and bipolar worse. I was to the point where I could not get out of bed.<br/>
            The one thing that saved me were my cats. I could not let my cats down. I had to be there for them. I would <br/>
            get up and feed them and clean their litter box, and they stuck by me through it all. Whenever I felt like giving <br/>
            up, I would think about my cats and cancel any plans for killing myself.<br/>
            In late 2019 my migraines changed into complex migraines. At least once a month I was having a migraine that <br/>
            acted like a stroke. I would pass out and not remember anything. I would not be able to walk and had to stay <br/>
            in the hospital for a week at a time. It took me several weeks to regain complete control only to have it happen again.<br/>
            I seriously stayed in bed all day and night. I got up to take care of my cats, but I was not taking care of myself.<br/>
            And I was hardly eating.<br/> 
            One time my discharge papers had comments on them about migraines and foods you should avoid. My mom read through it <br/>
            and did some research. It turns out that 90% of the foods I was eating were considered bad for migraines. Even good for<br/>
            you foods like avocados and healthy yogurt. We made the big decision for me to stop eating all those foods. It was<br/>
            very hard, and I was depressed over it.<br/> 
            I continued to stay in bed with my old routine. However, little by little the complex migraines stopped and eventually<br/>
            all my headaches went away. I felt like a new person. Several months later, my depression, anxiety and bipolar improved.<br/>
            The medication I was on was working, and I was off the numerous medications for migraines. The many side effects went away.<br/>
            I was able to start a part-time job and earn a little more money. I got a new computer and got back on the internet and social <br/>
            media. I still have depression, anxiety and bipolar, but I can handle it much better.<br/> 
            The reason I am sharing all of this is because your mental health is important. If you feel suicidal, don’t hesitate <br/>
            to call for help. The national hotline number is 988 (United States of America). For a list of hotlines in other countries,<br/>
